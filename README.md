# 🚗 Wireless HMI System for Automotive Applications

This project is a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) system designed for cars, enabling wireless communication between the driver and vehicle systems via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The interface is built using QML and deployed on ESP32 to handle real-time control, status monitoring, and simulated call/SMS functionalities.
